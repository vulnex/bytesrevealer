# Bytes Revealer

Version: 0.3

Bytes Revealer is a powerful reverse engineering and binary analysis tool designed for security researchers, forensic analysts, and developers. With features like hex view, visual representation, string extraction, entropy calculation, and file signature detection, it helps users uncover hidden data inside files. Whether you are analyzing malware, debugging binaries, or investigating unknown file formats, Bytes Revealer makes it easy to explore, search, and extract valuable information from any binary file.

Bytes Revealer do NOT store any file or data. All analysis is performed in your browser.

Current Limitation: Files less than 50MB can perform all analysis, files bigger up to 1.5GB will only do Visual View and Hex View analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Node.js 14+ is required
node -v
```

### Docker Usage

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

Now open your browser: http://localhost:8080/

To stop the docker container

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vulnex/bytesrevealer

# Navigate to project directory
cd bytesrevealer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Usage

1. **File Upload**
   - Click "Choose File" or drag and drop a file
   - Progress bar shows upload and analysis status

2. **Analysis Views**
   - Switch between views using the tab interface
   - Each view provides different analysis perspectives
   - Real-time updates as you navigate

3. **Search Functions**
   - Use the search bar for pattern matching
   - Toggle between hex and string search modes
   - Results are highlighted in the current view

4. **String Analysis**
   - View extracted strings with type and length
   - Filter strings by type or content
   - Sort by various criteria
   - Export results in multiple formats

## Performance Considerations

- Large files are processed in chunks
- Web Workers handle intensive operations
- Memory usage is optimized
- Operations can be canceled if needed
